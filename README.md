### Future TODO:

- Known Bugs:
  - Sometimes the ai response is not proper JSON so my parse breaks (tried to clean it up and have proper error handling, but the ai response varies a lot)

- addtional features (for later):
  - show multiple images for the food in a nice slide show like: https://youtu.be/PkADl0HubMY?si=LQ176HmrO-dLX5ws 
  - error handling for when ai responses fail
  - add calorie count and serving size?
  - add a health grade/sentiment for the food
