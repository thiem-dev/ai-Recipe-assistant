## Tech used:
- **PALM2 ai API**:
  - Where to get API key: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey 
  - Is it free? Yes, sorta: https://ngyibin.medium.com/how-to-get-access-to-googles-palm-2-large-language-model-21379f27c078#:~:text=At this stage%2C you may,use%2C unlike GPT-4. 
  - Google Cloud Console: for managing/view compute/usage stats https://console.cloud.google.com/ 
  - Basic Hello World: https://developers.generativeai.google/tutorials/text_node_quickstart 
  - Why not use Bard?
    - It doesn't consistently work with its cookie system: 
    - Resources if you want to work with Bard anyways: 
        - APIkey: As of 17 Nov, 2023 it is no longer available.

- **NeonDB**: Free Postgres DB. See: https://neon.tech/
- **Expressjs**: Backend web framework for api server. See: https://expressjs.com/

## Personal Notes

### Workflows guide for myself in future
- ... ?

### Future TODO:

- Known Bugs:
  - Sometimes the ai response is not proper JSON so my parse breaks (tried to clean it up and have proper error handling, but the ai response varies a lot)

- addtional features (for later):
  - show multiple images for the food in a nice slide show like: https://youtu.be/PkADl0HubMY?si=LQ176HmrO-dLX5ws 
  - error handling for when ai responses fail
  - add calorie count and serving size?
  - add a health grade/sentiment for the food
